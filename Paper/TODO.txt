Intro: 
1) based on newton-like observers (Grizzle)
2) Fault detection - faults on actuators - control approach (Xiao)
3) Fault detection - faults on sensors - NL observer (Seiied)
4) Joint state and dynamics modelling - GP models nonparametric (BuissonFenet)

Results:
1) state and parameters estimation
2) No injection term - optimisation driven

Development:
1) offline usage to tune the model
2) NN to approximate J, not the fault term
